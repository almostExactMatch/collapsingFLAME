This is the repository for the paper Collapsing-Fast-Large-Almost-Matching-Exactly: A Matching Method for Causal Inference. 

The "experiments" folder contains jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results from the paper.

Please follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the FLAME algorithms and obtain the dataframe for the matched groups and estimated CATEs.  

All scripts are in Python.
