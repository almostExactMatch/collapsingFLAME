# collapsingFLAME
This is the repository for the paper [Collapsing-Fast-Large-Almost-Matching-Exactly: A Matching Method for Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent). 

* **Step1**

      clone this repository;
      
* **Step2**
      
      Make sure all required packages are up-to-date (see requirements.txt);

* **Step3**  

      To reproduce <name-of-experiment>:  
      open the experiments/<name-of-experiement> notebook and run all cells;
      
The "experiments" folder contains jupyter notebooks to reproduce the results from the paper.
Please follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the FLAME algorithms and obtain the dataframe for the matched groups and estimated CATEs.

**All scripts are in Python**.
